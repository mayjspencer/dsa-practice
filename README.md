# Data Structures & Algorithms Curriculum

This repo contains my structured, step-by-step journey through Python-based DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) and technical interview prep.

- I'm practicing each concept, building on what I learned in school
- Focused on **LeetCode**, **Python**, and **interview preparation**

## Linear Data Structures (Module 1)

### ✅ Arrays & Lists
- Indexing, slicing, common methods  
- Time/space complexity  
- Mutability and memory  

### ✅ Stacks
- LIFO, use cases  
- `list` vs `collections.deque`  
- Time/space complexity  

### ✅ Queues
- FIFO, use cases  
- Variants: simple, deque, circular, priority  
- Python’s `queue` and `collections.deque`  

### ✅ Hash Tables (Dictionaries)
- Hashing basics, collision handling  
- Dictionary methods  
- Efficiency tradeoffs  

### ✅ Sets
- Membership, uniqueness, operations  
- Set vs list/dict  
- Hashing and performance  

### ✅ Two Pointers / Sliding Window
- Fixed-size window  
- Variable-size window  
- Opposite-end technique  

---

## Recursion & Searching (Module 2)

### ✅ Recursion
- Base case, recursive case  
- Stack frames and memory cost  

### ✅ Linear vs Binary Search
- Iterative and recursive binary search  
- Sorted array requirement  
- Time and space tradeoffs  

---

## Trees (Module 3)

### ✅ Tree Basics
- Structure, parent/child/sibling  
- Binary trees vs general trees  

### ✅ Binary Trees
- In-order, pre-order, post-order traversal  
- DFS vs BFS  
- Time and space complexity  

### ✅ Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Insert, delete, search  
- Efficiency vs hash tables  

### ✅ Tree Traversals
- DFS (recursive & iterative)  
- BFS using queue  
- Applications  

---

## ✅ Heaps & Priority Queues (Module 4)

- Min-heap vs Max-heap  
- Python’s `heapq`  
- Use cases: Dijkstra, task scheduling  
- Time and space efficiency  

---

## Graphs (Module 5)

### ✅ Graph Representation
- Adjacency list vs matrix  
- Directed vs undirected  
- Weighted vs unweighted  

### ✅ Graph Traversal
- BFS, DFS  
- Topological sort (Kahn’s, DFS)  

### ✅ Pathfinding
- Dijkstra’s algorithm  
- A*, Floyd-Warshall (optional)  

---

## ✅ Sorting Algorithms (Module 6)

- Bubble, Insertion, Selection (intuitive)  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  
- Python’s built-in sort and Timsort
