# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repo contains my hands-on practice with data structures, algorithms, and common problem-solving techniques. Each folder contains categorized problems and solutions with comments.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- Basic Structures (arrays, strings, hashing)
- Queues & Stacks
- Trees & Graphs
- Search & Sort Algorithms
- Common Techniques (two pointers, sliding window, recursion, etc.)

## ðŸ“Œ Goal

To master problem-solving patterns, prep for technical interviews, and build a structured DSA reference from scratch.

## ðŸ›  Language

All problems solved in **Python 3**
